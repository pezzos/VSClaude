# VSClaude - Visual Studio Code Extension Project

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: VSClaude  
**Project Type**: VS Code Extension Development  
**Methodology**: Claude Code Agile  
**Initialized**: 2025-07-19  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-22  

## Vision Statement

Develop a comprehensive Visual Studio Code extension that integrates Claude Code's agile development workflow directly into the IDE. The extension provides a visual tree-based interface for managing projects, epics, stories, and tasks while enabling seamless execution of Claude Code commands from within VS Code.

## Core Objectives

1. **Visual Workflow Management**: Transform Claude Code's text-based workflow into an intuitive graphical interface
2. **Seamless Integration**: Enable direct execution of Claude Code commands from VS Code
3. **Real-time State Tracking**: Provide live updates of project, epic, and task status
4. **Developer Productivity**: Reduce context switching and improve development efficiency
5. **Educational Tool**: Help developers learn and adopt Claude Code methodology

## Key Features

### Phase 1 - Core Functionality (MVP)
- Interactive workflow tree view in VS Code sidebar
- Project state detection and visualization
- Basic command execution integration
- File navigation and document opening
- Manual refresh capabilities

### Phase 2 - Enhanced Experience
- Automatic file watching and state synchronization
- Context-aware command suggestions
- Progress tracking and metrics
- Quick pick commands and shortcuts
- Status bar integration

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
- GitHub integration for configuration management
- Collaborative workflow features
- Custom templates and project scaffolding
- Analytics and reporting
- Multi-project support
