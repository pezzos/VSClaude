I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end. Make sure you fix all the linting, compilation or validation issues after successful implementation of the plan.

### Observations

I've analyzed the VSCode extension codebase and understand the current architecture. The extension uses a traditional TreeDataProvider with hierarchical tree view showing projects, epics, stories, and tickets. The user wants to transform this into a modern Traycer-style interface with task panels, status indicators, detailed implementation plans, and interactive capabilities. The current system has solid foundations with StateManager, CommandExecutor, and OutputLogProvider that can be leveraged for the new UI.

### Approach

The transformation will involve creating a new WebviewViewProvider alongside the existing tree view, implementing a modern task-oriented interface similar to Traycer Extension. We'll maintain the existing command execution infrastructure while adding a new webview-based UI layer. The approach includes creating a webview panel, implementing bidirectional communication, designing a modern React-based interface, and gradually migrating functionality from the tree view to the new interface.

### Reasoning

I explored the extension's codebase by examining the main components: WorkflowTreeProvider (current tree implementation), extension.ts (activation and registration), types.ts (data structures), StateManager (state management), CommandExecutor (command execution), OutputLogProvider (output handling), and CommandRegistry (available commands). This gave me a complete understanding of the current architecture and how to transform it into a Traycer-style interface.

## Proposed File Changes

### src/webview/WorkflowWebviewProvider.ts(NEW)

References: 

- src/providers/WorkflowTreeProvider.ts(MODIFY)
- src/providers/StateManager.ts
- src/commands/CommandExecutor.ts

Create a new WebviewViewProvider class that implements the Traycer-style interface. This provider will:

- Implement \`vscode.WebviewViewProvider\` interface
- Register as a webview view in the same container as the current tree view
- Handle webview creation, HTML content generation, and resource management
- Implement bidirectional communication with the webview using \`postMessage\` API
- Subscribe to state changes from \`StateManager\` to update the UI in real-time
- Handle command execution requests from the webview by delegating to existing \`CommandExecutor\`
- Manage webview lifecycle (show/hide, dispose, state persistence)
- Provide methods for updating project state, command status, and output logs
- Include CSP (Content Security Policy) configuration for security
- Handle webview panel focus and visibility events

### src/webview/protocol.ts(NEW)

References: 

- src/types.ts

Define TypeScript interfaces for webview communication protocol. This file will contain:

- Message type enums for different communication types (PROJECT_STATE_UPDATE, EXECUTE_COMMAND, COMMAND_STATUS_UPDATE, etc.)
- Request/response interfaces for each message type
- Serializable versions of existing types (\`ProjectState\`, \`Epic\`, \`Story\`, \`Ticket\`) without VSCode-specific classes
- Command execution request/response interfaces
- State update notification interfaces
- Error handling message types
- Type guards and validation functions for message parsing
- Documentation for the communication protocol

This ensures type safety for all webview â†” extension communication.

### src/webview/StateEventBus.ts(NEW)

- Handle debouncing of rapid state changes to prevent UI thrashing
- Provide typed event interfaces for different state change types
