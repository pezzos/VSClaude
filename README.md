# VSClaude

A new project initialized with Claude Code workflow structure.

## Overview

This project uses the Claude Code agile workflow system for organized development and documentation.

## Structure

```
docs/
├── 1-project/     # Global project vision and roadmap
├── 2-current-epic/ # Current epic execution
├── 3-current-task/ # Current task details
└── archive/       # Completed epics backup
```

## Getting Started

1. Define your project vision with `/project:agile:start [description]`
2. Design the architecture with `/project:agile:design`
3. Plan the implementation with `/project:agile:plan`
4. Execute iteratively with `/project:agile:iterate`
5. Ship releases with `/project:agile:ship`

## Development Workflow

This project follows the Claude Code agile methodology:
- **Epic-Level**: start → design → plan
- **Iteration-Level**: iterate → ship → clear

Refer to CLAUDE.md for detailed workflow instructions.
